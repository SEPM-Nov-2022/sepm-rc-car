# Meeting notes
## 27/11/2022
- team contract: to be finalized and sent. Agreed to accept all of Marianne’s edits and sign
- Confirmed meeting schedule availability
- Discussed toy concept: how to scope our project.
  - We drafted an outline of the document.
  - Now we should start filling it with the content.
  - When the content will be complete, we will review the sections to improve the presentation.
  - Word count: instructions conflict on page count/word count: will proceed with 1000 words and confirm with Oli.
  - Will make use of charts/diagrams
- Decided to use the race car concept and demonstrate functionality in a retro video game
- we will try to get feedback before the final submission in Unit 6
- the project will be scrum-like to have some intermediate milestones to get feedback and to compensate for geographic dispersion of team and varying availability
- Alberto has created a GitHub project for this assignment, teammates added - we will use this to develop and document our software. 
- Alberto also loaded Gherkin requirements into the site based on Rob’s preliminary race car requirements
- Walked through Djordje’s template and Marianne’s revisions; combined pragmatic format with assignment criteria
- May break out a separate section for “objectives” if needed; will adjust sections and tables as content develops
- we have three (initial) groups of requirements:
  - basic driving
  - parental control
  - analytics
- we have three (initial) stakeholders related to the requirements:
  - the children
  - the parents
  - the company producing the toy
